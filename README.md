NLP Chatbot with Python
This repository contains the code and resources for a chatbot built using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques in Python. The project is based on the concepts and techniques covered in the Udemy course "NLP with Python".

Project Overview
This chatbot is designed to demonstrate the application of NLP in creating conversational agents. It processes user input, understands the intent, and generates appropriate responses. The project leverages libraries such as NLTK, SpaCy, and TensorFlow, among others, to implement various NLP tasks including tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, and model training.

Features
Text Preprocessing: Includes techniques such as tokenization, stopword removal, stemming, and lemmatization.
Intent Classification: Utilizes machine learning models to classify user intents based on their input.
Response Generation: Generates contextually appropriate responses using predefined templates or trained models.
Extensibility: The chatbot framework is designed to be easily extendable, allowing for the integration of additional intents, responses, and more advanced NLP models.
